# iplot
Inline animated PLOTting

This is all released as copyleft under the GNU GPL v3.0 licence. Have fun!

## Overview

This Python module is a simple bit of code that allows you to write interactive animated plots in an intuitive and learner friendly fashion. The main ethos here is to allow a programmer to build code and add a line here and there from `iplot` *without fundamentally changing the code itself*.

This inline behaviour by extension also allows one to also use `iplot` for handy debugging purposes. Unsure about what's breaking inside your loop-within-a-loop-within-a-loop? Add a couple of lines of `iplot` and debug away!

## Installation

### For the tinkerers
You can Git clone this repository and have a fiddle with the module (`/iplot`).

### For the users
You can install this directly using `pip` (currently on the TestPyPi index):

```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ iplot
```

## Examples

If you're downloading this from the `iplot` Github ([https://github.com/benjaminwoods/iplot](https://github.com/benjaminwoods/iplot)), there are a few examples included with this Python module. A proper README is coming soon!
